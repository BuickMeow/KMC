## How can I contribute to the language support?
It's pretty easy and straightforward!<br>
Follow these easy steps:

1. Create a folder called "KMC translation" (Or whatever you want it to be called).
2. Download the base file ["Lang.resx"](https://github.com/KaleidonKep99/Keppys-MIDI-Converter/blob/master/KeppyMIDIConverter/Languages/Lang.resx). Right-click "Raw" and select "Save as > .resx file". Remember to save it inside the folder you created on your desktop.

**If you're translating to a new language:**

3. Make a copy of "Lang.resx", and rename it to *"Lang.cultureinfocode.resx"*, with the Culture Info code of your country/language, [which you can find here](http://timtrott.co.uk/culture-codes/). **(IT NEEDS TO BE IN THE SAME FOLDER AS lang.resx)**

**Else:**

3. Download the language you want to update [from there](https://github.com/KaleidonKep99/Keppys-MIDI-Converter/tree/master/KeppyMIDIConverter/Languages). As before, right-click "Raw" and select "Save as > .resx file". **(IT NEEDS TO BE IN THE SAME FOLDER AS LANG.RESX)**

4. *(If you don't have it)* Download and install ResEx [from there] (https://resex.codeplex.com/).
5. Open the "Lang.resx" file.
6. Start translating it to your language.

When you're done, send the file **"Lang.(yourlanguagecodehere).resx"** to me through this form: https://goo.gl/forms/aHSvJescUqCYCHiN2<br><br>
Thank you in advance! :heart: :heart:
