A fully functional MIDI to WAV converter, for FREE!

## Where did you get the idea?
This was actually supposed to be a clone of [Free MIDI to MP3 Converter] (http://mp3-tools.com/free-midi-to-mp3-converter.html), then I changed myself, and had the idea of making my OWN converter, with my OWN stuff.

## What's the filesize limit?
120 million notes in rendering mode, 60 million notes in live playback mode.

## Windows SmartScreen tells me that this app might infect my computer. Are you trying to steal my data???
Why would I publish KMC on GitHub, to get sued by them? I already have money issues irl, no needs to have more on the Internet.
Anyway no, the files are completely safe. The source code is online, even. Take a look if you don't trust my words.

## How can I get the converter without installing it?
There's a portable version of Keppy's MIDI Converter too. [Take a look here] (https://github.com/KaleidonKep99/Keppys-MIDI-Converter/releases).

## Is there any version for Linux and Mac OS X?
