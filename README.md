# Keppy's MIDI Converter
A fully functional MIDI to WAV converter, suitable for normal AND heavy MIDIs! (Up to 500 million notes for 32-bit version, unlimited [sorta?] for 64-bit version)

## How can I get the converter without installing it?
You could use [innounp] (http://innounp.sourceforge.net/), but the setup writes a lot of dependencies in the registry, so I can't confirm that it'll work.
Here, take the registry key of the converter, but again, I can't confirm anything. [>>> Right Click > Save as... <<<] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KaleidonKep99/Keppys-MIDI-Converter/master/KeppySpartanMIDIConverter/KeppyMIDIConverterRegFile.reg)
