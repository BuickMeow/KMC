A fully functional MIDI to WAV converter, for FREE!

## Can I use your program's source code for my program?
Sure you can, but there are a few "rules" you need to follow.
- Do not make ports of this app for phones. I want it to be "computer-exclusive".
- Give me proper credits when using part of my code, and give proper credits to Ian or BASS.NET when using their libraries.
- Please do not use parts of this program for a nuclear attack. The last thing I want is the FBI visiting me at home.

## Where did you get the idea?
This was actually supposed to be a clone of [Free MIDI to MP3 Converter] (http://mp3-tools.com/free-midi-to-mp3-converter.html), then I changed myself, and had the idea of making my OWN converter, with my OWN stuff.

## Windows SmartScreen tells me that this app might infect my computer. Are you trying to steal my data???
Why would I publish KMC on GitHub, to get sued by them? I already have money issues irl, no needs to have more on the Internet.
Anyway no, the files are completely safe. The source code is online, even. Take a look if you don't trust my words.

## How can I get the converter without installing it?
There's a portable version of Keppy's MIDI Converter too. [Take a look here] (https://github.com/KaleidonKep99/Keppys-MIDI-Converter/releases).

## Is there any version for Linux and Mac OS X?

## How can I edit a translation
It's pretty easy and straightforward!<br>
Follow these easy steps:

1. Create a folder called "KMC translation" (Or whatever you want it to be called).
2. Download the base file ["Lang.resx"] (https://github.com/KaleidonKep99/Keppys-MIDI-Converter/blob/master/KeppyMIDIConverter/Languages/Lang.resx). Right-click "Raw" and select "Save as > .resx file". Remember to save it inside the folder you created on your desktop.
3. Download the language you want to update [from there] (https://github.com/KaleidonKep99/Keppys-MIDI-Converter/tree/master/KeppyMIDIConverter/Languages). As before, right-click "Raw" and select "Save as > .resx file". **(IT NEEDS TO BE IN THE SAME FOLDER AS LANG.RESX)**
4. *(If you don't have it)* Download and install ResEx [from there] (https://resex.codeplex.com/).
5. Open the "Lang.resx" file.
6. Happy editing! :smile:

When you're done, send the file **"Lang.(yourlanguagehere).resx"** to me through this form: https://goo.gl/forms/aHSvJescUqCYCHiN2<br><br>
Thank you in advance! :heart: :heart:
